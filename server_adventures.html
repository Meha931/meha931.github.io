        <p>...or a rant on the difficulty of making a personal server</p>

        <p>
            If you want to make a server that can be accessed anywhere, then you need to
            be prepared for quite a journey. Making an accessible server is not very easy,
            although not impossible.
        </p>
        <h1>The server itself</h1>
        <p>
            Getting <em>just</em> a server is not difficult, you just need a machine that
            can run all day long. <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/">Raspberry Pi</a>
            is a good option, it's relatively cheap and doesn't consume much electricity,
            though you'll probebly need to buy additional cooling for newer models.<br>
            You can already use it as a server in a local network, but it's not very
            interesting if it can't be connected from the Internet.<br>
            ...or you can rent a server, that's an easy option
        </p>
        <h1>NAT so easy</h1>
        <p>
            Some might warn you about having to open/forward ports on your modem. This might
            be needed at home, but in some cases it might not work. There can be three cases:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    If you use a rented server, you probably don't have to do anything.
                    Though you should check the control panel for that server to see
                    if there's an option to open ports;
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you use one of your machines as a server and you're in a small house,
                    then you probably just have to do that forwarding thing, after which
                    your server can be accessed through your external IP;
                </li>
                <li>
                    ...probably, because it might fail, especially in multi-apartment houses,
                    because you technically would have to do port forwarding on your router
                    <i>and</i> your ISP's router (because why would they assign external IPs
                    to every single apartment when one can be enough, there aren't many free
                    IPv4 addresses), which is unreachable by you.<br>
                    You have few other options then:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Ask ISP to provide you with a dedicated IP (which I wouldn't do
                            because I don't think I'll use the correct terminology);
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Use ngrok <s>which is proprietary thing and is basically a
                            variant of the next option</s>;
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Rent a server to be a VPN router and proxy connections though
                            this tunnel to your server.<br>
                            Which is what I did.<br>
                            Kind of defeats the reason for having your server, but it might
                            be reasonable if you don't want to rent a powerful machine but
                            rather use your own.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h1>Claim the domain</h1>
        <p>
            If you have a dynamic IP, you should get a dynamic DNS to have access to your
            server in case IP changes. You can also use it as a free domain for a static IP,
            but if you want a fancy name for it, some money must be spent.<br>
            .ru and .xyz seem pretty cheap &#129300;
        </p>
        <h1>[lock emoji &#128272;]</h1>
        <p>
            ...and it would be good idea to additionally encrypt connection to that server.
            Certificates are free, there's no much reason not to get one
        </p>
        <h1>Usage</h1>
        <p>
            And now your server's set. Host a website/cloud/game, make an app, use an app...
            whatever you wanted a server for.
